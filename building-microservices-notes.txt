Strong cohesion and loose coupling

Any technology that pushes us to expose internal representation detail should be avoided. Share behaviour not representation.

Orchestration Versus Choreography

keep your middleware dumb, and keep the smarts in the endpoints

don’t violate DRY within a microservice, but be relaxed about violating DRY across all services. The evils of too much coupling between services are far worse than the problems caused by code duplication

----

Eventual consistency (local retry until it works) VS Distributed transaction (transaction manager -> 2 phase commit)

class-responsibility-collaboration (CRC) cards with services used as class

----

Avoid "configuration drift": the code in source control no longer reflects the configuration of the running host
We can resolve it with "Immutable servers"
