Microservices are ideal for big systems
Microservice architecture is goal-oriented
Microservices are focused on replaceability

At the end of our three-day meeting, one of us called out a theme—that year it had been clear that many of the problems people were facing in the wild were related to building systems that were too big. “How can I rebuild a part of this,” “best ways to implement Strangler,” etc.
Turning that on its head, the problem became “how can we build systems that are replaceable over being maintainable?”
We used the term micro apps, I seem to remember.
—James Lewis

Microservices are small, autonomous services that work together.
—Sam Newman, Thoughtworks

Loosely coupled service-oriented architecture with bounded contexts.
—Adrian Cockcroft, Battery Ventures

A microservice is an independently deployable component of bounded scope that supports interoperability through message-based communication.
Microservice architecture is a style of engineering highly automated, evolvable software systems made up of capability-aligned microservices.
-Martin Fowler

microservice applications share some important characteristics:
• Small in size
• Messaging enabled
• Bounded by contexts
• Autonomously developed
• Independently deployable
• Decentralized
• Built and released with automated processes
