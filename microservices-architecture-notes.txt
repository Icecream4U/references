Microservices are ideal for big systems
Microservice architecture is goal-oriented
Microservices are focused on replaceability

At the end of our three-day meeting, one of us called out a theme—that year it had been clear that many of the problems people were facing in the wild were related to building systems that were too big. “How can I rebuild a part of this,” “best ways to implement Strangler,” etc.
Turning that on its head, the problem became “how can we build systems that are replaceable over being maintainable?”
We used the term micro apps, I seem to remember.
—James Lewis

Microservices are small, autonomous services that work together.
—Sam Newman, Thoughtworks

Loosely coupled service-oriented architecture with bounded contexts.
—Adrian Cockcroft, Battery Ventures

A microservice is an independently deployable component of bounded scope that supports interoperability through message-based communication.
Microservice architecture is a style of engineering highly automated, evolvable software systems made up of capability-aligned microservices.
-Martin Fowler

microservice applications share some important characteristics:
• Small in size
• Messaging enabled
• Bounded by contexts
• Autonomously developed
• Independently deployable
• Decentralized
• Built and released with automated processes

Speed and Safety at Scale and in Harmony.
—The Microservices Way

* Speed of Change: Most organizations have the platforms, tools, and infrastructure in place to implement thousands of application releases within a single day. But they don’t. In fact, most teams are happy if they can manage a release in a week. Why is that? The answer of course is that the real deterrent to release speed is the fragility of the software they’ve produced.
* Safety of Change: Every change is potentially a breaking change and a system optimized purely for speed is only realistic if the cost of breaking the system is near zero. Most development environments are optimized for release speed, enabling the software developer to make multiple changes in as short a time as possible. On the other hand, most production environments are optimized for safety, restricting the rate of change to those releases that carry the minimum risk of damage.
* At Scale: microservices style is rooted in the idea of solving the problems that arise when software gets too big. To build at scale means to build software that can continue to work when demand grows beyond our initial expectations. Systems that can work at scale don’t break when under pressure; instead they incorporate built-in mechanisms to increase capacity in a safe way.
* In Harmony: microservice architecture is not limited to a simple series of decisions regarding speed and safety of change. The microservices domain is actually fairly complex and will require you to understand a wide breadth of concepts that have a great depth of impact.

The greater the cohesion of individual modules in the system, the lower the coupling between modules will be.
—Larry Constantine and Edward Yourdon, authors of Structured Design: Funda‐ mentals of a Discipline of Computer Program and Systems Design

The key in making great and growable systems is much more to design how its modules communicate rather than what their internal properties and behaviors should be.
—Alan Kay, 1998 email to the Squeak-dev list (http://lists.squeakfoundation.org/pipermail/squeak-dev/1998-October/017019.html)
